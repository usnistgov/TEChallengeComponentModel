- model.glm has different values for upper_tank_setpoint and lower_tank_setpoint
    - David will provide new CSV with additional column for the setpoint, as well as correct GLM file
- which triplex_meter voltage to read?
    - David will dig for more info
- ramp function step size?
    - Continuous (as possible, given UCEF step size)
