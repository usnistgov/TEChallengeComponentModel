- how should Hpp = 2+Tau/6 be rounded
    - Tom will change to nearest integer rather than ceiling

    - David will provide the files
    - Tom will implement the file parsing
- need some good representative houses to check
    - Tom will select highest lambda, lowest lambda, middle lambda
- which triplex_meter voltage to read?
    - David will dig for more info
- ramp function step size?
    - Continuous (as possible, given UCEF step size)
- how to handle the first day
    - RO blast of all the DAP prices
    - boolean array[24] = false foreach hour to check if that DAP has been received
    - auto-advance to time advancing as soon as all elements of the array are true (alternatively - just keep int counter)
